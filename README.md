## Introduction

The **Student Performance Analyzer** helps you understand how different factors affect student performance. It uses data analysis techniques to visualize and interpret data. This project emphasizes practical learning with Python, focusing on key functions that make data manipulation easier.

## Features

- Analyze student data from Kaggle datasets.
- Visualize performance metrics using graphs.
- Filter data based on specific criteria.
- Use `lambda` functions for quick data transformations.
- Implement `map()` to apply functions to data sets efficiently.

## Installation

To get started with the **Student Performance Analyzer**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fed1323/Student_Performance_Analyzer.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
